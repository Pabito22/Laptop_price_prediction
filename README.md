## Laptop price prediction
The objective of this project is to create a ML model that will predict prices of a laptop based on its specyfication. 

### Data set
I am working on the dataset downloaded from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price   
This dataset consists of 1042 examples, where each example contains the following columns:

1 Company- String -Laptop Manufacturer
2 Product -String -Brand and Model
3 TypeName -String -Type (Notebook, Ultrabook, Gaming, etc.)
4 Inches -Numeric- Screen Size
5 ScreenResolution -String- Screen Resolution
6 Cpu- String -Central Processing Unit (CPU)
7 Ram -String- Laptop RAM
8 Memory -String- Hard Disk / SSD Memory
9 GPU -String- Graphics Processing Units (GPU)
10 OpSys -String- Operating System
11 Weight -String- Laptop Weight
12 Price_euros -Numeric- Price (Euro)

I am extracting information from these columns to create a machine learning model for price prediction.

### Technologies used   
Project is created with:   
* Python version 3.11.5
* Pandas version 2.0.3
* NumPy version 1.24.3
* Scikit-learn version 1.3.0
* Jupyter Notebook version 6.5.4

### Current Status
This project is currently in development. I am exploring different machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning the model to achieve optimal performance.
